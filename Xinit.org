#+DESCRIPTION: My personal xinit configuration file.
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle ~/.xinitrc


The xinit program allows a user to manually start an Xorg display server. The
=startx= script is a front-end for xinit.

* Xbindkeys
Load Xbindkeys program for binding key chords.
#+begin_src conf
  xbindkeys -f ~/.config/xbindkeys/config
#+end_src

* Wallpaper
Set wallpaper.
#+begin_src conf
  feh --bg-scale ~/.local/share/wallpaper.png
#+end_src

* Number Lock
Enable numlock at boot time.
#+begin_src conf
  numlockx on
#+end_src

* Unclutter
Unclutter hides your X mouse cursor when you do not need it, to prevent it from
getting in the way. You have only to move the mouse to restore the mouse
cursor. Unclutter is very useful in tiling window managers where you do not
need the mouse often.
#+begin_src conf :tangle no
  unclutter --timeout 2 &
#+end_src

* Notification
Dunst is a lightweight replacement for the notification-daemons provided by
most desktop environments.
#+begin_src conf

managers that do not provide compositing.
#+begin_src conf
  picom --xrender-sync-fence &
#+end_src

* i3 Window Manager
Load i3wm (Window Manager), this must be always at the end.
#+begin_src conf
  exec i3
#+end_src
