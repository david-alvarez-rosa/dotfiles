Xbindkeys is a program that allows to bind commands to certain keys or key
combinations on the keyboard. Xbindkeys works with multimedia keys and is
independent of the window manager and desktop environment.


* Volume
Commands for controlling the volume. This binds laptop =Fn= keys for adjust
audio, such as volume (increase, drecrease) and toggle mute status.

Commands for increasing and decreasing the volume have an step size of 5, but
using =Shift= modifier on this keys will change step size to 10 and using
=Ctrl= modifier to 1.
#+begin_src conf
  "pamixer -i 5"
    XF86AudioRaiseVolume
  "pamixer -i 10"
    Shift + XF86AudioRaiseVolume
  "pamixer -i 1"
    Control + XF86AudioRaiseVolume

  "pamixer -d 5"
    XF86AudioLowerVolume
  "pamixer -d 10"
    Shift + XF86AudioLowerVolume
  "pamixer -d 1"
    Control + XF86AudioLowerVolume
#+end_src

Remember that is possible to allow volume boost (volume above 100%), from the
command line with =pamixer -i --allow-boost <arg>=.

Toggle mute status.
#+begin_src conf
  "pamixer -t"
    XF86AudioMute
#+end_src

* Backlight Brightness
Due to incompatibility problems, I am using Acpilight (a backward-compatible
xbacklight replacement) for setting the display brightness. This programm uses
the ACPI interface and can control both display and keyboard backlight
uniformly on either X11, the console or Wayland. Personally I am just using
this for display brightness in X.

Similarly to the volume control bindings, I am providing here functionality for
increasing and decreasing brightness with =Fn= laptop keys with a step size
of 5. If this keys are combined with =Shift= modifier the step size changes to
10, and when combined with =Ctrl= to 1.

#+begin_src conf
  "xbacklight -inc 5"
    XF86MonBrightnessUp
  "xbacklight -inc 10"
    Shift + XF86MonBrightnessUp
  "xbacklight -inc 1"
    Control + XF86MonBrightnessUp

  "xbacklight -dec 5"
    XF86MonBrightnessDown
  "xbacklight -dec 10"
    Shift + XF86MonBrightnessDown
  "xbacklight -dec 1"
    Control + XF86MonBrightnessDown
#+end_src
