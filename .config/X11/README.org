#+DESCRIPTION: My personal xinit configuration file.
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle xinitrc


The xinit program allows a user to manually start an Xorg display server. The
=startx= script is a front-end for xinit.

* Keyboard
Set default Xorg keyboard configuration to =es= and =us= and set =Menu= key for
toggling between keyboard layouts.
#+begin_src conf
  setxkbmap -layout us,es -option grp:menu_toggle
#+end_src

Modify the keyboard layout, with two symmetric =Control= keys in the home row,
for a great Emacs experience:
- =CapsLock= will behave as =Escape= when pressed alone and as =Control= when
  combined with other keys. =CapsLock= functionality can be retrieved with
  =Shift+CapsLock=.
- =Enter= will behave as =Enter= when pressed alone and as =Control= when
  combined with other keys.
The configuration that follows is pretty ugly and difficult to understand,
sorry for that. Take a look at xcape man page for more information about how
this has been done.
#+begin_src conf
  xmodmap -e "clear lock"
  xmodmap -e "add Control = Caps_Lock"
  xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Control_L Caps_Lock NoSymbol NoSymbol"
  spare_modifier="Hyper_L"
  xmodmap -e "keycode 36 = $spare_modifier"
  xmodmap -e "remove mod4 = $spare_modifier"
  xmodmap -e "add Control = $spare_modifier"
  xmodmap -e "keycode any = Return"
  xcape -e "Control_L=Escape;$spare_modifier=Return"
#+end_src

Adjusting typematic delay and rate. The typematic delay indicates the amount of
time (typically in milliseconds) a key needs to be pressed and held in order
for the repeating process to begin. After the repeating process has been
triggered, the character will be repeated with a certain frequency (usually
given in Hz) specified by the typematic rate. This can be configured with
=xset= utility, specifying /rate/ and /delay/ in this order.
#+begin_src conf
  xset r rate 275 60
#+end_src

Load Xbindkeys program for binding key chords.
#+begin_src conf
  xbindkeys -f ~/.config/xbindkeys/config
#+end_src

Enable numlock at boot time.
#+begin_src conf
  numlockx on
#+end_src

* Theme
Set wallpaper.
#+begin_src conf
  feh --bg-scale --no-fehbg ~/.local/share/wallpaper.png
#+end_src

Unclutter hides your X mouse cursor when you do not need it, to prevent it from
getting in the way. You have only to move the mouse to restore the mouse
cursor. Unclutter is very useful in tiling window managers where you do not
need the mouse often.
#+begin_src conf
  unclutter --timeout 2 &
#+end_src

Dunst is a lightweight replacement for the notification-daemons provided by
most desktop environments.
#+begin_src conf
  dunst &
#+end_src

Picom is a standalone compositor for Xorg, suitable for use with window
managers that do not provide compositing.
#+begin_src conf
  picom --xrender-sync-fence &
#+end_src

* Autostart programs
Automatically start Emacs.
#+begin_src conf
  emacs &
#+end_src

* i3 Window Manager
Load i3wm (Window Manager), this must be always at the end.
#+begin_src conf
  exec i3
#+end_src
