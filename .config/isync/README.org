Isync is a command line application to synchronize mailboxes; it supports
Maildir and IMAP4 mailboxes. New messages, message deletions and flag changes
can be propagated both ways.

Synchronization is based on unique message identifiers (UIDs), so no
identification conflicts can occur (as opposed to some other mail
synchronizers). Synchronization state is kept in one local text file per
mailbox pair; multiple replicas of a mailbox can be maintained.

The =authinfo.gpg= file should be properly configured and encrypted with, at
least, the following information.
#+begin_src conf :tangle no
  machine mail.alvarezrosa.com login david port 587 password "***pass***"
  machine smtp.yandex.com login david.alvarez.rosa port 587 password "***pass***"
#+end_src

After the first sync of emails, the =mu= database must be started. It is useful
to specify personal email addresses (e.g., for not replying to yourself in a
"Reply All").
#+begin_src conf :tangle no
  mu init -m ~/.local/share/mail --my-address=david@alvarezrosa.com --my-address=davids@alvarezrosa.com --my-address=dalvrosa@amazon.com
