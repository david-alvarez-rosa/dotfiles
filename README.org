This repository is intended to be a backup of my personal configuration files
(also know as dotfiles). Most of the configuration files are written in
literate style using Emacs Org Mode. And then this files are tangled so can
actually be used as configuration files.

I use this dotfiles in my main work machine running Arch Linux as my prefered
Linux distribution. Please, if you are planning to use this dotfiles in your
machine, don't expect them to work out of the box. There might be some fixes
you will need to perform to adapt this configuration to your distro of choice.
